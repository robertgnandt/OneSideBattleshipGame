# OneSide - BattleShipGame

Steps to build and run:
1. Download / Clone the project from GitHub
2. Build Battleship.App
3. Run the Battleship\bin\Debug\BattleShip.App.exe and Enjoy the game
4. For test purpose, if you run the project in Debug mode after the Ships are placed on Board, their positions will be displayed



Initial Requirements:

The challenge is to program a simple version of the game Battleships. Create an application to allow a
single human player to play a one-sided game of Battleships against ships placed by the computer.
The program should create a 10x10 grid, and place several ships on the grid at random with the
following sizes:
· 1x Battleship (5 squares)
· 2x Destroyers (4 squares)
The player enters coordinates of the form “A5”, where "A" is the column and "5" is the row, to specify a
square to target. Shots result in hits, misses or sinks. The game ends when all ships are sunk.
You can write a console application or UI to complete the task.
Try to code the challenge as you would approach any typical work task; we are not looking for you to
show knowledge of frameworks or unusual programming language features. Most importantly, keep it
simple.
